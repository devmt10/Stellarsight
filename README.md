### How This Will Render:

- **Bold text**: Text inside `**` will be bold (e.g., `**Bold Text**`).
- **Headings**: Text following `#` will be a heading. The more `#` symbols, the smaller the header (e.g., `# Main Header`, `## Sub Header`).
- **Lists**: Items starting with `-` will render as bullet points.
- **Code blocks**: Code will be formatted inside backticks or fenced with triple backticks (```` ``` ````).

You can now copy and paste this into your `README.md` file, and it should render beautifully with proper Markdown formatting on GitHub.

Let me know if you need further help with this!
